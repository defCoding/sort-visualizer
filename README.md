# sort-visualizer

A program that visualizes various sorting algorithms, created using Windows Forms through Visual Studio and C#. A Sorter model class takes care of the sorting, and raises an event to send to the UI whenever a specific occurence needs to be drawn. The user can define the size of the array, the range of values within the array, and the speed at which the sorting animation is run at.
